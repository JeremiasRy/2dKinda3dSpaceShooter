A console application game. 

To play you'll need microsoft visual studio. Git clone and run program!

The program uses screenbuffer to run smoothly. 
I also had to use GetKeyboardState api to make my own controls since Console.ReadKey() only reads one input at a time.

The mp4 to gif converter I used made weird blue lines in the gif.
