A console application game. 

To play you'll need microsoft visual studio. Git clone and run program!

The program uses screenbuffer to run smoothly. 
I also had to use GetKeyboardState api to make my own controls since Console.ReadKey() only reads one input at a time.

Here's a nice gif to demonstrate game action:
